      <p>Happy birthday, Rhain.</p>
  
      <p>You’re 22 now.<br>
      Maybe this is the first time I’ve made something special for your birthday.<br>
      This whole journey, this gift, was made with just “copy and paste”…<br>
      But it carries all the memories and love I feel for you.</p>
  
      <p>When we first met, I was 16 and you were 18 (I think).<br>
      Thinking back on those days and everything since—<br>
      there are too many memories to fit into this one website.</p>
  
      <p>So I’ve prepared another way to keep our memories together.<br>
      (You’ll find out soon.)</p>
  
      <p>It’s always been hard for me to express my feelings through letters.<br>
      But I want you to know—<br>
      <strong>making this website for you has never once felt like a chore.</strong></p>
  
      <p>I started writing this letter around March 27th,<br>
      and now, as this journey ends, I want to say one thing:</p>
  
      <p><strong>Thank you for traveling with me.</strong><br>
      From Perth to Osaka,<br>
      you’ve collected every moment with me,<br>
      and each of those memories is one of the most important in my entire life.</p>
  
      <p>Every place, every laugh, every scene—<br>
      they’ve all settled deep in my heart,<br>
      and I’ll remember them forever as if they happened just yesterday.</p>
  
      <p>Next time, we’ll meet in your country.<br>
      I’ll be there to see your graduation ceremony,<br>
      and I’m really looking forward to it.</p>
  
      <p>I love you.</p>
